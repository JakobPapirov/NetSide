# NetSide
The purpose of this branch is to develop the core functionality of the game and its mechanics. This is version of the game is entirely run within a local terminal, does not have the ability to save player's progress and the interface is entirely text-based and navigated using user input (player enters numbers corresponding to actions).

Game is written in python 3.9.5

# Branches

In this branch I'll commit front-end related code (JS). Another part is the core mechanics of the game, located in its own branch (Python). A third branch houses the back-end (Django).

As each component is ready for merger, I'll push to master branch and it'll become master again. Presently, game-dev is the default branch.
