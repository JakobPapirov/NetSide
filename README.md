# NetSide

In this branch I'll commit back-end related code (Django). Another part is the core mechanics of the game, located in its own branch (Python). A third branch houses the front-end (JS).

As each component is ready for merger, I'll push to master branch and it'll become master again. Presently, game-dev is the default branch.
