On my path to learn Python (and more webdev), I've decided to make a game!

Update Jun 2020
The backend will be written in Django and hosted on my Vultr VPS.

Update Aug 2017
The game will still be written in Python, but made available/playable to users via front-end (a website). For the back-end I will be using NodeJS.
