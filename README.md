# NetSide

CSS will be handled by TailwindCSS

In this branch I'll commit front-end related code (JS). Another part is the core mechanics of the game, located in its own branch (Python). A third branch houses the back-end (Django).

As each component is ready for merger, I'll push to master branch and it'll become master again. Presently, game-dev is the default branch.
