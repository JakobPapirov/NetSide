Introduction to the game

The idea behind the game is a mix between the subreddit /r/outside and the computer game nethack.
My game, Netside, is played out today and is thought to be a simulation of the world with bad stuff happening.

The game is played online in a terminal emulator. The game code run on a server.
As the game is text-based, the player types in commands and reads the results!

You create a character and you want to improve it while staying alive! You also wish to explore the environment.
Your character *might have* the following stats (body):
Head(s), eye(s), ear(s), arm(s) and leg(s); stats (atributes)
Intelligence (int), agility (agi), strength (str); and stats (other)
Health, stamina, focus, vitality
